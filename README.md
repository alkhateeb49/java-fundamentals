## linter: Lab03

File I/O

Linter checks if there are semicolons at the end of a line in js file. If your line doesn't contain "if", "else", end with a "{", "}", or if the line is empty, then you're missing a necessary semicolon in your file. You can expect to see similar to the below in the output, showing you which line is missing a necessary semicolon ,reads a JavaScript file with a given Path, and generates an error message whenever it finds a line that doesn’t end in a semi-colon.
